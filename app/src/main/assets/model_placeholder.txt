# This is a placeholder file for the TensorFlow Lite model
# Replace this with your actual .tflite model file

# Your model should:
# - Accept input shape [30, 1662] 
# - Output classification probabilities
# - Be named exactly "sign_language_model.tflite"

# To add your real model:
# 1. Place your .tflite file here
# 2. Rename it to "sign_language_model.tflite"
# 3. Rebuild the app
